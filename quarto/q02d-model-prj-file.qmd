## `The model.prj` file {#sec-model-prj-file}

While the file is a single entity, it is convenient to examine the different sections separately in the order they occur in the file (see below). 

Values are separated by spaces or tabs. Character-based input (e.g., fleet names, etc.) should not contain spaces, tabs, or "#", but can contain numbers and punctuation. An underscore ("_") is used to indicate a space--underscores will be replaced by spaces in formatted model output (e.g., in tables or figures). 

An example of how the model projection information is specified is given in the following text box:
