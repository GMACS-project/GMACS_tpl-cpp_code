## `The gmacs.dat` file {#sec-gmacs-dat-file}

The `gmacs.dat` file specifies the paths to the `.dat`, `.ctl`, and `.prj` files, as well as the weight units, the stock name, specifications for parameter jittering, whether variances are determined for various output quantities, the number of peels to use for a retrospective model run, and other details affecting a model run. An example based on the snow crab assessment model is given in the text box.

::: {.callout-note title="Example `gmacs.dat` file."}

```default
## Input files
snow.dat #--relative path to the data file
snow.ctl #--relative path to control file
snow.prj #--relative path to projection file

## Other information
1000_mt       # Weight unit
EBS_Snow_crab # Stock name

### Jitter specs
0    #--flag to jitter parameters (0=no, 1=yes)
0.1  #--std. deviation for jittering

### Flags (0=no, 1=yes) to output variances for the following quantities
1   # Reference points
0   # Recruits
0   # SSB
0   # Fbar
0   # OutDynB0

0   #--number of peels for retrospective

### Other controls
   10      # Maximum phase (estimation stops after this phase).																					
   -1      # Maximum number of function calls, if 1, stop at fn1 call; if -1 run as long as it takes
    1      # Calculate reference points (0=no, 1=yes)
    0      # 1 to use a pin file (1) to initialize parameter values, 0 for a normal run
    0      # VERBOSE FLAG (0 = off, 1 = on, 2 = objective func; 3 diagnostics)

9999 #EOF (end-of-file marker)

```

:::

The "#" is used to begin a comment; any text prefaced with "#" is ignored. Input character strings (e.g., the weight units or the stock name) must not contain spaces. An underscore ("_") is used to indicate a space--underscores will be replaced by spaces in formatted model output (e.g., in tables or figures). The end of the file is marked by "9999" as a diagnostic check that all information has been read.
